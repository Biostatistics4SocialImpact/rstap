### Spatial Temporal Aggregated Predictor Models Implemented in R

This is an R package that fits spatial temporal aggregated predictor models   
using [Stan](http://mc-stan.org) (via the **rstan** package) for the back-end
estimation. The primary target audience is researchers interested in the effect of the built environment features (BEFs) on human health.

**Please Note** This package is still in development. Download and use with extreme caution.
